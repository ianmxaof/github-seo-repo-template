## Example Repositories for Presets

This directory is reserved for short write-ups of real repositories that embody each preset.

For each preset (indie-hacker, open-source-maintainer, portfolio-dev, enterprise-internal), add:

- Repository link
- Why it is a good example for that preset
- Notes on naming, description, topics, and README structure

At the moment these are placeholders; replace them with real examples as you dogfood the tool on your own account and other willing accounts.
