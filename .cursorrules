# Project Philosophy — GitHub Account Presentation Optimizer

This project exists to analyze and suggest improvements to the public-facing presentation of GitHub repositories across an entire account.

## Core Principles

- The tool is advisory, never authoritative.
- The tool does not mutate repositories automatically.
- Suggestions must be explainable and grounded in detected repository state.
- Presets define presentation philosophy, not rigid templates.
- Human-in-the-loop decision making is mandatory.

## Scope Constraints

- Read-only GitHub API access by default.
- CLI is the primary interface; dashboards are derived views.
- No automatic commits or content writes.
- No ranking or scoring against other users.

## What This Project Is Not

- Not a growth hacking tool.
- Not an SEO spam generator.
- Not a GitHub account manager.
- Not a content factory.

## Development Guidance

- Favor semantic analysis over heuristics.
- Prefer explicit data models over implicit assumptions.
- Optimize for clarity, not cleverness.
- Any new feature must directly improve presentation coherence.

If a feature does not help a human understand how a repository presents itself, it is out of scope.
